#Description
In this project, you understand how to apply image data augmentation in Keras using the ImageDataGenerator class from Kerasâ€™ image preprocessing package, 
and variety of options available in this class for data augmentation and data normalization such as
  1. Rotation
  2. Width and Height Shifts
  3. Brightness
  4. Shear Transformation
  5. Zoom
  6. Channel Shift
  7. Horizontal and Vertical Flips
  8. Data Normalization
  9. Rescale and Preprocessing Function
